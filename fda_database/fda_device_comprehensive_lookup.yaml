name: fda_device_comprehensive_lookup
description: |
  Perform a comprehensive device lookup across multiple FDA databases.
  Searches adverse events, 510(k) clearances, recalls, and UDI information
  in a single operation. Essential for complete device due diligence,
  competitive analysis, and regulatory research.
  
  Data sources combined:
  - Device adverse events (MAUDE)
  - 510(k) clearances
  - Recall/enforcement reports
  - UDI database

required_parameters:
  - name: device_name
    type: string
    description: "Device name or brand name to search"

optional_parameters:
  - name: limit_per_source
    type: integer
    description: "Maximum results per data source"
    default: 10
  - name: api_key
    type: string
    description: "FDA API key for higher rate limits"

hardware_requirements:
  - "Internet connection required"
  - "No GPU required"
  - "Minimal RAM (< 2GB)"

time_complexity: "O(1) - Multiple API calls, typically < 20 seconds total"

outputs:
  - name: adverse_events
    type: list
    description: "Device adverse event reports"
  - name: clearances_510k
    type: list
    description: "510(k) premarket clearances"
  - name: recalls
    type: list
    description: "Recall and enforcement reports"
  - name: udi_info
    type: list
    description: "Unique Device Identification records"

failure_modes:
  - condition: "Device not found"
    behavior: "Returns empty arrays for each source"
  - condition: "One source fails"
    behavior: "Partial results returned"
